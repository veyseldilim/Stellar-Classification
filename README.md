# Stellar-Classification
A machine learning project to classify stars.

#Introduction

Stellar classification is the classification of stars based on their characteristic features. Stellar classification is one of the subtopics of Astronomy. The dataset contains 7 features (columns) for each star. These features are:

1)	Temperature (Numeric Values in Kelvin)
2)	Relative Luminosity (Numeric Values)
3)	Relative Radius (Numeric Values)
4)	Absolute Magnitude (Numeric Values)
5)	General Observed Color (Nominal)
6)	Spectral Class (Nominal)
7)	Type (Target Feature – Discrete Numeric)

Possible values of Type target feature are 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.

Red dwarf – 0
Brown dwarf – 1
White dwarf – 2
Main Sequence – 3
Super Giant – 4
Hyper Giant – 5
